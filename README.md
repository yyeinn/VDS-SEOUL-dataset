# VDS-SEOUL-dataset  

**Dataset owner: VDS Lab, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea**  
  
There are 54 scenes including buildings, sky, trees, and grass.  
All scenes were acquired from the campuses of Seoul National University, Yonsei University, and Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.  
RAW files (.CR3) for each scene were directly acquired.  
Unlike JPEG, which is a lossy compression format, RAW is an uncompressed or lossless compression format, so it retains the original image with higher quality.  
RAW files are 14bit and have a size of 6000*4000 pixels.  
RAW files were converted to DNG, a more widely usable and safer file format, using Adobe.  
LDR images corresponding to 7 different exposures (EV-3 to +3) and HDR files were converted using DNG.  

**Camera and environment settings information**  
- Camera Model: Canon EOS 200D II  
- F-stop: F/10  
- Exposure time: 1/200s  
- ISO sensitivity: ISO-100
